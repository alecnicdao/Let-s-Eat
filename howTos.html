                    <p class="subtitle">Tips for you during COVID-19:</p>
                    <h3>Wash your hands, counter, and other surfaces you’ve touched</h3>
                    <p>Do this after you've put away the groceries. Keep in mind that using a disinfectant isn’t necessary unless you’re 
                        sharing a space with someone who is exhibiting signs of respiratory illness or has been exposed to the virus.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wash produce</h3>
                    <p>Rubbing fruit and vegetables under running water—and scrubbing those with hard skins—can help remove pesticides.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Go shopping at a time that’s less busy</h3>
                    <p>If you type in the store’s name and location in Google search, a box often will pop up showing 
                        when foot traffic there is highest.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Wear a face covering</h3>
                    <p>The new advice from the CDC on face masks is voluntary. The agency says the non-medical coverings 
                        can be "basic cloth or fabric masks."
                    </p>

                    <h3>Take germicide with you</h3>
                    <p>Use it to wipe your hands and the cart before and after you shop.</p>

                    <h3>Use a credit or debit card</h3>
                    <p>That way, you don’t have to hand over bills or receive change. Also, use your own pen to sign receipts. 
                        If you can, use a virtual payment system like Apple Pay so that you don't have to open your wallet at all.

                        This classic béchamel-based mac and cheese is loaded to the hilt with cheese. 
                        Not only do we pack as much cheese as we can into the sauce itself, but we then 
                        mix the cooked pasta and cheese sauce with additional grated cheese, for tiny pockets 
                        of stretchy, melty bits throughout. One of the benefits of this method is that you can 
                        get enhanced browning in the oven, especially on the bottom and sides of the baking dish, 
                        thanks to the flour and butter in the sauce.

                        The key to super-fluffy mashed potatoes is to remove as much starch from the spuds as possible. 
                        We accomplish this by peeling and dicing them before rinsing them in water and boiling them just 
                        until cooked. After cooking, they get a final rinse before heading to the ricer. Using a ricer or 
                        food mill prevents excess damage to the starch granules, helping the potatoes remain nice and light.

                    <p>
                        For us, as kids growing up in Utah, fried chicken came from one place, and one place only: 
                        those grease-stained cardboard buckets peddled by the Colonel himself. But times have changed, and 
                        as is often the case, revisiting those fond childhood memories results only in disappointment and disillusionment. 
                        That said, stylistically, it can't be faulted. So I figured that I could somehow manage to take what the Colonel 
                        started and bring it to its ultimate conclusion—that is, deep chicken flavor; a flab-free skin; juicy, tender meat; 
                        and crisp, spicy coating—I might just be able to recapture those first fleeting childhood tastes of fried chicken 
                        as I remembered them. Here's the result of my efforts.

                        If you want perfectly cooked steaks every time, with almost no gray band of overcooked meat beneath the surface, the 
                        reverse sear is the best method to use. It works for any thick-cut steak—strip steak, ribeye steak, porterhouse steak, 
                        tomahawk steak, T-bone steak, tri-tip, and filet mignon. Simply start the steak in a low oven, let it cook slowly until 
                        it reaches your desired internal temperature, then sear it in a screaming-hot pan or on the grill to quickly put a beautiful 
                        burnished crust on the exterior. Alternatively, you can do this entirely on the grill using a two-zone fire, starting the 
                        steaks on the cooler side and finishing them on the hot side. Either way, it's easy and nearly foolproof, and it delivers 
                        absolutely stunning results.

                        A truly great cheesesteak harnesses the powers of bread, meat, and cheese, and, like Captain Planet, becomes an ass-kicking 
                        sandwich hero far greater than the sum of its parts. It is a magnificent trifecta of juicy, thin-cut beef; crisp, chewy roll; 
                        and tangy, salty, gooey cheese. Let's just say that if Proust lived in Philadelphia, he would have written about cheesesteaks 
                        instead of madeleines.

                        For most people who live outside of the southern US, the opportunities to taste excellent, smoky, low-and-slow Southern-style 
                        barbecue pork ribs are few and far between. You may be lucky enough to have a backyard and a smoker or Kettle grill, but even 
                        then, nailing that perfect temperature time after time can be a tricky affair that takes years of practice to get right. Enter 
                        sous vide. With a vacuum sealer and a precision cooker in your kitchen, you're guaranteed perfect results every time. I'm talking 
                        pork ribs with a crusty bark or rich glaze of sauce and a texture that's tender yet meaty. Ribs that don't fall off the bone—any 
                        barbecue lover will tell you that ribs that fall off the bone are overcooked—but that release with just a gentle tug of the teeth.

                        It should go without saying that food must, at the very least, taste good. That's the low bar. If you can also make it a riot of colors, 
                        so much the better. And that's a pretty impressive feat when your main ingredient is the drab brown color of cooked beef—because it is 
                        cooked beef. We think our Korean-style beef bulgogi burritos accomplish this admirably. Bulgogi ("fire meat" in Korean) is beef that's 
                        thinly sliced, marinated, and quickly seared. It's usually made with pricey ribeye, but you can also use English-cut boneless short ribs 
                        (our favorite) or sirloin. If you're slicing the beef yourself, you'll want it as thin as you can get it; an eighth of an inch or less is 
                        ideal. Using a very sharp knife is essential, and make sure to slice against the grain of the meat, which shortens the muscle fibers and 
                        makes the meat more tender.

                        The onions are dressed with vinegar, the cheese is slightly tangy Red Leicester, the bacon and pickles are...bacon and pickles. Then he takes 
                        finely chopped iceberg lettuce and mixes it into a sauce that one might say is 'special'—mayo and ketchup with chipotle Tabasco, Worcestershire, 
                        and a splash of booze (just go with it; it works and is silly good). The burger itself gets glazed with mustard and more of the smoky Tabasco 
                        while it cooks, then it's all piled on a seeded brioche bun, which has been briefly toasted in the bacon fat. Bonkers. You'll have juice up 
                        to your elbows and a plate full of run-off that you will want to wipe clean with a torn piece of bun or your tongue, depending on how insane 
                        it makes you feel.

                        We all know what Caesar salad is: chopped romaine lettuce and garlicky croutons, tossed in a creamy dressing made with eggs, olive oil, lemon, 
                        Parmesan, Worcestershire sauce, and anchovies. There's a reason that in the 90 years since its invention, it's become the default second salad 
                        option at every single major restaurant chain in the country. Even when mass-produced, this combination of savory, creamy, tangy, and crunchy 
                        ingredients is tasty stuff. But we can do better than those chains in our own kitchens, I hope. These days, most Caesar salads are made with an 
                        emulsified, premixed, intensely flavored creamy dressing, rather than with the loosely emulsified mix that forms when you attempt Julia's take 
                        on Caesar's original recipe. So, my question: Can we combine lessons from the authentic and the modern versions of the salad to come up with 
                        something even greater?

                        For such a simple dish, French onion soup should be easy to make great. And yet, so many versions taste like a cup of burnt-onion tea with melted 
                        cheese trying its best to cover up the flaws. This recipe develops great flavor with a long, slow caramelization of the onions, then punches it 
                        up with cider vinegar, fresh chives, and a surprise ingredient: fish sauce.

                      I've made this recipe a few times now and it's delicious! I've taken it to pot lucks and it's been a real hit! Since I didn't have mango, 
                      I substituted with peaches and nectarines and I used grape tomatoes.

                  <p>
                    Emphatically the king of curries, and perhaps the king of all foods. Spicy, coconutty, sweet and savory. Even the packet sauce you buy from the supermarket 
                    can make the most delinquent of cooks look like a Michelin potential. Thankfully, someone invented rice, with which diners can mop up the last drizzles of 
                    curry sauce. "The Land of Smiles" isn't just a marketing catch-line. It's a result of being born in a land where the world's most delicious food is sold on 
                    nearly every street corner.

                  <p>
                    Spare us the lumpy chain monstrosities and "everything-on-it" wheels of greed. The best pizza was and still is the simple Neapolitan, an invention now protected 
                    by its own trade association that insists on sea salt, high-grade wheat flour, the use of only three types of fresh tomatoes, hand-rolled dough and the strict use 
                    of a wood-fired oven, among other quality stipulations. With just a few ingredients -- dough, tomatoes, olive oil, salt and basil (the marinara pizza does not even 
                    contain cheese) -- the Neapolitans created a food that few make properly, but everyone enjoys thoroughly.

                    The Mayans drank it, Lasse Hallström made a film about it and the rest of us get over the guilt of eating too much of it by eating more of it. The story of the humble
                    cacao bean is a bona fide out-of-the-jungle, into-civilization tale of culinary wonder. Without this creamy, bitter-sweet confection, Valentine's Day would be all cards 
                    and flowers, Easter would turn back into another dull religious event.

                    (especially great when fused with ginger), that'll have your nose running before the spoon even hits your lips.

                    Flaky pastry smothered in butter, a pile of raspberry jam smeared over the top and a soft, giving bite as you sink in your teeth; there's nothing not to love about this 
                    fatty, sweet breakfast food that must be married to a cup of strong coffee.

                  <p>
                    This oft-mispronounced national dish ("fuh" is correct) is just broth, fresh rice noodles, a few herbs and usually chicken or beef. But it's greater than the sum of its 
                    parts -- fragrant, tasty and balanced.

                    Second only to pizza in the list of famed Italian foods, there's a reason this pasta-layered, tomato-sauce-infused, minced-meaty gift to kids and adults alike is 
                    so popular -- it just works.

                    Melted Parmesan and mozzarella cheese, and a peppery, garlicky tomato sauce drizzled over the top of a chicken fillet -- Aussie pub-goers claim this ostensibly Italian
                     dish as their own. Since they make it so well, there's no point in arguing.
