						Jackson Hayes was originally hired as a line cook at The Paleo People in Los Angeles. In the space of only a few years, advanced first to Sous 
						Chef and then, in 2015, was promoted to become Chef of The Paleo People. In 2016, Jackson moved across the street from Paleo to Bestia, taking
						on the position of Chef of Bestia. Then in 2018, Let's Eat poached him to cook amazing dishes for their website. Jackson believes the first year of 
						cooking food with a Mediterranean emphasis at Paleo brought everything together for him: how to focus on one or two ingredients in a dish and make 
						them shine, how to keep things simple and interesting, and most important of all, how to work with the seasons.

						Alastair Nicdao was born in Layton, Utah. He is currently going to Weber State University majoring in Web & User Experience and minoring in Computer
						Science. To him the idea of this whole thing was why not start connecting with either top chefs in the world or just anyone that is interested in cooking
						famous dishes. After that he wanted to design a website specfically about food that all those chefs have either made or just something they are trying out. Below
						are his steps for making this all a dream:
